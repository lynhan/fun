    can buy and sell more than once
    must sell current stock before buying another
Approach
    if we visualize the prices as a line graph over time
        and divide the graph into sections by local maximums
        we can get the max profit by summing the difference between local max and min
    so we can modify the original approach such that
        when max profit so far changes, we add it to total profit
